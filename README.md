# PING!

This project is carried out in collaboration with ANM and the Academy of Fine Arts. The goal is to revolutionize the LOGES system in stations, offering concrete assistance to blind, visually impaired, and orientation-challenged individuals. The project uses iBeacon sensors to track movements in space. When a person needs to catch a specific train, the system activates to provide guidance through vibrations and visual signals on the route to follow. Additionally, the app is fully compatible with iOS VoiceOver.

In the project, I specifically handled the back-end part related to route calculation and the logic of the route screen, including vibration near the beacons and the graphical effect of the dot enlarging as you approach.

## Main Features

- **iBeacon Tracking:** Utilizes iBeacon sensors to track movements and provide precise guidance.
- **VoiceOver Compatibility:** The app is fully accessible through iOS VoiceOver.
- **Vibration Feedback:** The system provides guidance through vibrations to assist the user.
- **Visual Signals:** Graphical effects that help the user better orient themselves in space.

## How It Works

1. **Route Configuration:**
   - The user selects the desired destination, and the system calculates the optimal route.
   - The route screen with precise guidance is displayed.

2. **Assisted Navigation:**
   - During navigation, the user receives feedback through vibrations when approaching a beacon.
   - The graphical effects show a dot that enlarges to indicate proximity to the beacon.

3. **VoiceOver Compatibility:**
   - The app works perfectly with VoiceOver, providing voice descriptions for each guidance.
